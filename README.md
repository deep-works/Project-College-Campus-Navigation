#Project-College-Campus-Navigation

This project report details the development of an AI-powered campus guide for Chandernagore College, "Vision Guide Chandernagore College,". The system uses deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a ResNet18 model, for image-based navigation.
The core objective is multi-output classification, simultaneously identifying building names (Administrative, Heritage, Chemistry, Gurudeb) and their orientation (Front, Left, Right) relative to the user. A custom image dataset of 366 images from the college campus was created and manually annotated for this purpose.
